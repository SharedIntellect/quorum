# Quorum — Brand Guide

## Name

**Quorum**  
Formal: *Quorum*  
Abbreviated: *Quorum*  
Never: *Validator Swarm*, *TheQuorum*, *Q9*

---

## Core Identity

Quorum is **infrastructure**, not a product or a research project.  
Its tone is: **precise, confident, no-nonsense, evidence-driven.**

What it's not:
- Clever or cute (it's a quality gate, not a chatbot)
- Academic (it ships and runs in production)
- Defensive (it's proud of its gaps and roadmap)

The one-line: **"A production-grade quality gate for agent systems."**

## Logo

### Primary Mark: The Q Wordmark

The Quorum logo is a stylized **"Quorum"** wordmark with an oversized capital Q. Flowing, interweaving gradient lines emerge from the Q's form, evoking **convergence, consensus, and interconnection** — the core concept of agents reaching quorum. The lines terminate in small circular nodes representing connection endpoints.

**Key files:**
- `quorum-logo-final.jpg` — Primary logo (white background)
- `quorum-readme-banner.png` — README header with tagline
- `quorum-social-preview-final.png` — GitHub/social preview (1280×640)

**Usage rules:**
- Minimum clear space: 1× the height of the lowercase "o" on all sides
- Minimum size: 120px wide for digital, 1" wide for print
- Do not rotate, stretch, recolor, or add effects
- On dark backgrounds, use a version with adjusted contrast (TBD)

### Color Palette

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| **Quorum Navy** | `#1a2744` | Primary text, wordmark |
| **Quorum Cyan** | `#2ba4c8` | Primary accent, taglines, badges, flowing lines |
| **Mid Blue** | `#2078a8` | Secondary accent, rating badges |
| **Light Aqua** | `#7dd4e8` | Gradient start on flowing lines |
| **Slate** | `#555555` | Secondary text, feature descriptions |
| **White** | `#FFFFFF` | Primary background |
| **Caution Amber** | `#FFB300` | PASS_WITH_NOTES, warnings, partial states |
| **Critical Red** | `#FF1744` | CRITICAL issues, REJECT verdict |

**Rationale:** The navy + cyan palette communicates professionalism and trust while the gradient lines add dynamism. The issue severity colors (green/amber/red) map directly to Quorum's verdict taxonomy.

### Typography

- **Logo wordmark:** Bold sans-serif (as rendered in logo asset)
- **Headlines:** Exo 2 Bold (matches SharedIntellect site)
- **Body:** Exo 2 Regular or Inter Regular
- **Code:** JetBrains Mono or Fira Code
- **Avoid:** Serif fonts, decorative fonts, anything that reads as "startup-y"

## What Not To Do

- Don't use corporate stock imagery
- Don't use the "AI brain" or neural network aesthetic
- Don't call it a "framework" (it's a system)
- Don't soften the verdict language ("areas for improvement" → "CRITICAL issues")
- Don't imply it's a chatbot or conversational interface
- Don't place the logo on busy/patterned backgrounds
- Don't use the old green/black color scheme (deprecated v1–v4 concepts)

---

*Branding should communicate what the product actually is: rigorous, production-grade, evidence-driven infrastructure.*
