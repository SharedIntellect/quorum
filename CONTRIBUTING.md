# Contributing to Quorum

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Quorum. This document covers how to get involved.

## Ways to Contribute

### 🔍 Submit Custom Rubrics

The rubric system is Quorum's most extensible surface. If you've built a rubric for a domain we don't cover yet, we'd love to include it.

**How:**
1. Create a JSON rubric following the format in `examples/rubrics/`
2. Test it against at least one real artifact
3. Open a PR adding it to `examples/rubrics/` with a brief description

**Good rubric contributions:**
- New domains (code review, documentation, API design, data pipelines)
- Specialized variants (security-focused, performance-focused)
- Industry-specific criteria (healthcare, finance, government)

### 🐛 Bug Reports

Found an issue? Open a GitHub Issue with:
- What you were validating (artifact type, depth profile)
- What you expected vs. what happened
- Model and tier configuration
- Any relevant log output

### 💡 Feature Proposals

Have an idea for a new critic, aggregation strategy, or rubric feature? Open a Discussion thread. We're particularly interested in:
- New critic specializations
- Alternative aggregation strategies
- Integration patterns with specific agent frameworks
- Cost optimization techniques

### 📝 Documentation

Improvements to docs, tutorials, and examples are always welcome. If something was confusing when you first used Quorum, it's probably confusing for others too.

### 🔬 External Reviews

Run Quorum against your own system and share the results. See `docs/EXTERNAL_REVIEWS.md` for how to submit.
