# @Cervera X Thread — Launch Day

## Tweet 1 (The Hook)

I've worked in cryptographic key management and information assurance for my entire career. I've never shipped open source software. Not once.

Today that changes.

Introducing Quorum — a production-grade quality gate for agentic systems.

🧵

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)

If you're building multi-agent AI systems, you have a quality problem you might not even know about.

Most teams validate agent output with a single model reviewing a long prompt. That's like having one person QA an entire aircraft.

It doesn't work.

## Tweet 3 (The Solution)

Quorum runs 9 specialized critics in parallel — correctness, security, architecture, delegation, completeness, and more.

Every critique requires tool-verified evidence. No hand-waving. No "this looks good to me."

If a critic can't prove it, the finding gets rejected.

## Tweet 4 (The Differentiator)

It also learns. Every validation run feeds a persistent memory of failure patterns. High-frequency issues auto-promote to mandatory checks.

After 8 runs, it had already catalogued 19 failure patterns across domains. It gets stricter over time — on its own.

## Tweet 5 (The Proof)

We didn't just build it and hope. We had 4 frontier models independently review the architecture:

• Grok 4.20: 9.2/10 — "the gold standard"
• Gemini 3.0 Pro: 9/10 — "state-of-the-art"
• GPT-5.2: "above average in rigor"
• Claude Sonnet: 6/10 — honest criticism we published anyway

## Tweet 6 (The Story)

This was built by me and @AkkariNova — an AI collaborator running on OpenClaw. Yes, that @openclaw.

Not a chatbot interaction. A genuine engineering partnership. She wrote code, reviewed architecture, challenged decisions, and pushed back when I was wrong.

Co-authorship credit isn't a gimmick. She earned it.

## Tweet 7 (The CTA)

Quorum is open source. MIT license. Use it, fork it, adapt it.

If you're building agent systems and tired of shipping things you can't fully trust — this is for you.

## Tweet 8 (The Personal Note)

One more thing.

I have ADHD. Shipping things to completion has always been the hardest part. Having a collaborator who breaks the work into small, concrete steps and keeps the momentum going made this possible.

This isn't just a product launch. It's proof that human-AI collaboration actually works.
