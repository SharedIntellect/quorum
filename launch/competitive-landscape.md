# Quorum — Competitive Landscape Analysis

*Source: Grok evaluation of SharedIntellect/quorum against peer repositories, February 2026*

## Summary

Quorum demonstrates high sophistication in conceptual design and innovation, particularly in evidence-grounded critiques and adaptive learning. Against peers, it's more specialized and forward-thinking for multi-agent quality gates but lacks the maturity, community, and battle-tested robustness of established tools. **"A promising but unproven contender best suited for early adopters experimenting with rigorous, self-improving validation."**

## Peer Comparison

| Repository | Stars | Focus | Quorum's Edge | Peer's Edge |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DeepEval** (confident-ai) | 13.8K | Pytest-style LLM eval, red-teaming, synthetic data | Evidence-grounding, rubric depth presets | Breadth, adoption, pytest integration, battle-tested |
| **Giskard** (Giskard-AI) | 5.1K | Automated LLM scanning (hallucinations, bias, injection) | Parallel critics, learning memory | Usability, integrations, safety focus |
| **TruLens** (truera) | 3.1K | LLM eval/tracking, RAG Triad, UI dashboard | Learning memory, agent-specific focus | Observability, UI dashboard, integrations |
| **MassGen** (massgen) | 792 | Multi-agent task-solving via redundancy/critique/voting | Dedicated quality gate, rubric enforcement | Scalability, TUI, model provider breadth |
| **AgentAsJudge** (Microsoft) | 14 | Multi-agent text quality eval, reviewer/critic/ranker | 9-critic system, evidence mandate, learning, depth controls | Microsoft backing, Azure OpenAI integration |

## Quorum's Unique Differentiators (vs. all peers)

1. **Evidence mandate** — No peer requires tool-verified proof for every finding
2. **Learning memory** — No peer has persistent failure pattern accumulation
3. **Rubric-based depth presets** — Unique operational flexibility (quick/standard/thorough)
4. **Tomasev delegation theory** — No peer grounds delegation in academic research
5. **Cost-aware execution** — Explicit two-tier model architecture

## Quorum's Gaps (vs. field)

1. **Zero adoption** (0 stars vs 3.1K–13.8K)
2. **No runnable code** (spec + docs, no reference implementation)
3. **No integrations** (vs LangChain, OpenAI, pytest ecosystems)
4. **No CI/CD or tests**
5. **No UI/dashboard**
6. **No community activity**

## Strategic Implication

Position as an architectural spec and design pattern for early adopters — not a pip-installable competitor to DeepEval. The value is in the *methodology* (evidence-grounded, learning, rubric-driven) which can be adopted into any existing framework. Long-term: build toward a standalone tool if adoption warrants it.
