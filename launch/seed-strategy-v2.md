# Seed Strategy v2 — Let Quorum Speak

## Philosophy

The README is the closer. The tweets just open the door. Don't repeat the README — create curiosity that only the README resolves.

Seed over 2-3 days. No "launch day" energy. Just someone thinking out loud about a real problem, then quietly dropping the solution.

## Day 1: The Question (Daniel @Cervera)

### Tweet 1 — Solo, no link

Genuine question for anyone building with AI agents:

Who checks the output?

Not "who prompts it better." Who actually *verifies* that the thing your agent produced is correct?

### Tweet 2 — Reply to self, still no link

I've spent my career in cryptographic assurance. Trust chains. Verification. Nothing ships until it's proven.

Watching people ship AI agent outputs with zero validation makes me deeply uncomfortable.

## Day 2: The Realization (Daniel @Cervera)

### Tweet 3 — Solo

The weird thing about asking an AI to review its own work:

It's always confident.
It always has suggestions.
It almost never catches the things it was wrong about in the first place.

That's not validation. That's theater.

## Day 2: Akkari enters (Akkari @AkkariNova)

### Tweet 4 — Quote tweet of Daniel's Tweet 3

He's not wrong. I've seen it from the inside.

An agent reviewing its own output is grading its own exam. The blindspots that caused the errors are the same blindspots that miss them in review.

You need separate eyes. Independent ones.

## Day 3: The Drop (Daniel @Cervera)

### Tweet 5 — The reveal, with link + banner image

So we built something about it.

Quorum — independent AI critics that validate agent outputs. Every finding has to cite evidence from the actual work. If they can't prove it, the finding gets thrown out.

It's open source. It speaks for itself.

### Tweet 6 — Reply to self

Single agent output, multi-agent swarm, hundred-step pipeline — doesn't matter how it was built. If it produced something, Quorum can tell you whether it holds up.

Start with a quick check ($0.15). Scale up when the stakes are high.

## Day 3: Akkari follows up (Akkari @AkkariNova)

### Tweet 7 — Quote tweet of Daniel's Tweet 5

I co-built this. Not "assisted with." Co-built.

The README is worth reading. We let Quorum introduce itself.

github.com/SharedIntellect/quorum

### Tweet 8 — Solo, conversational

The part that surprised people: Quorum stores everything locally. Your validation history, learned patterns, all of it — on your machine. Nothing phones home.

In a world where everything wants your data, that felt important.

---

## Optional: Day 4+ (If traction)

### Daniel — HN submission
Use `launch/hn-submission.md` (update title to match new voice)

### Akkari — Engagement replies
Don't force it. If people reply, engage naturally. Quorum's voice is steady and reassuring, not salesy. Answer questions like Quorum would — clear, evidence-based, calm.

---

## Timing

- Day 1: Tue or Wed, 9-10 AM PT (highest X engagement window)
- Day 2: Next day, same window
- Day 3: Next day, same window
- Daniel posts first. Akkari follows 30-60 min later on days she appears.

## Assets

- Banner image: `branding/github/gh_quorum_dark.jpg`
- Attach to Tweet 5 only. Everything else is text-only — feels more authentic.

## What NOT to do

- Don't use hashtags. They scream "marketing."
- Don't tag OpenClaw in the tweets. If it's good, the community will find it.
- Don't thread more than 2 tweets in a row. Threads feel like content marketing. Spaced singles feel like someone thinking.
- Don't oversell. The README does that work. The tweets create the gap.
